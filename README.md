# Classification Machine Learning Models

This repository contains various classification machine learning models implemented in Python. It serves as a collection of different approaches to solving classification problems using various algorithms and techniques.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms.
- Performance evaluation using various metrics.
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Visualization of results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Algorithms Used
